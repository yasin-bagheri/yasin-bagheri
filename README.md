### Hi there! I'm Yasin Bagheri. ðŸ‘‹
I am a web developer, and I'm very passionate and dedicated to my work.
With +5 years experience as a professional web developer, I have acquired knowledge necessary and top web technology skills to make my projects a success.
I enjoy every step of the develop process, from discussion and collaboration. I'm quietly confident, naturally curious, and perpetually working on improving myself.
